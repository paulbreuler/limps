# Agent 3: AI Generation — MOVED TO PLAN 0042

**This feature has been moved to a separate plan for cleaner scope separation.**

See: `plans/0042-ai-requirements-generation/` (to be created)

## Rationale

AI-assisted requirements generation is conceptually independent from semantic search infrastructure. Bundling unrelated features into a "grab bag" plan obscures scope and complicates dependency tracking.

The semantic search features (Agents 0-2) form a coherent unit. AI generation deserves its own plan with proper acceptance criteria.

## Original Scope (Preserved for Reference)

- generate_requirements MCP tool
- AI_DRAFT status marker
- Review checklist generation
- Optional LLM sub-query

**Status: MOVED — Do not implement in this plan**
